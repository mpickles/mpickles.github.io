                <p class="lead">
                    In this project, I dove into five years' worth of fantasy football data spanning QB, RB, WR, and TE
                    positions. My goal was to find stats that strongly influenced fantasy football rankings and then
                    spot players in the 2022 season with similar stats, aiming to pinpoint those likely to reach the top
                    12 or 24 ranks.
                    <br><br>
                    To get this project rolling, I collected data from FantasyPros.com covering the 2018-2022 seasons.
                    After giving it a good scrub to make sure it was reliable, I stored it in a local MySQL database for
                    easy analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, some stats like touchdowns and yards naturally play a big role in fantasy points, but what
                    really piqued my interest were the less obvious stats that can make or break a player's fantasy
                    season.
                    <br><br>
                    For this, I chose stats taht had a correlation coefficient with fantasy points over 0.75, meaning
                    they had a fairly high correlation.

                <!-- stats -->
                <p class="lead">
                    When it comes to quarterbacks, a couple of stats really stood out:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold"> - Rushing Attempts (0.78 correlation coefficient):</span><br>
                    This one's all about mobile, dual-threat quarterbacks. More rushing attempts usually mean they're
                    using their legs to score fantasy points.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Redzone Attempts (0.92 correlation coefficient): </span><br>
                    If a quarterback has a lot of red zone attempts, that often translates to more
                    touchdowns. It's a sign of a potent offense with plenty of scoring opportunities.
                </p>

                <!-- extra -->
                <p class="lead">
                    Surprisingly, Sacks and Interceptions, despite being seen as negative plays, actually have
                    a positive correlation with fantasy points. The reason? To get those stats, you've got to be
                    out on the field making plays.
                    <br><br>
                    Other important stats like Completion Percentage, Pass Attempts, and Air Yards make sense too.
                    They're closely tied to Passing Yards, which are a big part of PPR scoring. In essence, we're
                    looking for QBs who throw the ball a lot and do it accurately.

                <h4 class="fw-bold"> QB Data Analysis</h4>
                <p class="lead">When we dug into the data from the past five years, an intriguing trend emerged.
                    Quarterbacks who ranked in the top 15 for both Rushing Attempts and Redzone Targets in a given year
                    tended to maintain their positions within the top 12 the following year, often showing improvements
                    in their overall rankings (with 8 out of 14 actually improving).
                    <br><br>
                    Usually, if they were in the top 10, they managed to remain there in the subsequent year. The only
                    exception in this regard was Justin Herbert in 2022, who, unfortunately, faced an injury that
                    interrupted his season. This trend underscores the importance of these dual-threat capabilities -
                    both rushing attempts and redzone targets - as key indicators of a quarterback's fantasy football
                    performance.

                <!-- stats -->
                <p class="lead">
                    When it comes to running backs, there are a few standout stats that caught my eye:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Implied Attempts (0.97):</span><br>
                    This is a stat that combines Rushing Attempts and Targets. More touches mean
                    more opportunities to score, making it a vital indicator of a running back's fantasy potential.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Snaps (0.93):</span><br>
                    Snaps represent how many plays a running back was on the field for. The more they're
                    out there, the more chances they have to put points on the board. It's all about opportunity.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Broken Tackles (0.84):</span><br>
                    Broken Tackles are a fascinating metric that tells us how elusive or powerful
                    a running back is. The more tackles they break, the more you can count on them to gain extra yards.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Green Zone Attempts (0.83):</span><br>
                    This one looks at plays that occur between the 5-yard line and the opponent's endzone. It's a great
                    indicator of how often a running back gets the opportunity to score a touchdown, a critical fantasy
                    factor.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Explosive Plays (0.78):</span><br>
                    This stat measures the number of plays that go for 20+ yards. It gives us
                    insight into a running back's explosive playmaking ability and their knack for large chunk gains.

                <p class="lead">
                    When I dug into the running back data from the last five years, I noticed something interesting.
                    Predicting how running backs will do in the future can be a bit of a puzzle, but some stats really
                    popped out. Every running back who made it to the top 30 for Implied Attempts,
                    Snaps, Broken Tackles, Green Zone Attempts, and Explosive Plays ended up in the top 20 the next
                    year. Except for Derrick Henry in 2021 and David Montgomery in 2022 - but they hung around the top
                    24. Most others, though, saw their rankings drop in the following year. Over those five seasons, 17
                    out of 29 running backs actually fell in their rankings. Something important to note: running backs
                    who hit the top 30 in all five stats but weren't in the top 15 initially often jumped into the top
                    12 the next year, except for David Montgomery in 2021.

                <!-- stats -->
                <p class="lead">
                    Here are the stats that sttod out for Wide Receivers:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Target Share (0.96):</span><br>
                    This stat represents the percentage of the team's total
                    targets that a receiver gets. The higher this number, the more integral the receiver is to their
                    team's passing game.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Targets (0.97):</span><br>
                    It's pretty straightforward - this stat tells us the total number of times a
                    receiver was targeted. More targets usually mean more chances to make plays and score points for
                    fantasy.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">- Redzone Targets (0.84):</span><br>
                    These are the targets a receiver gets when they're in the red zone,
                    typically between the 20-yard line and the opponent's endzone. Redzone targets are crucial because
                    they often lead to touchdowns, a significant fantasy booster.
                    <br><br>
                    And while we won't consider Receptions, Receiving Yards, and Touchdowns here because they're already
                    built into PPR scoring, it's worth noting that Air Yards, Yards After Catch, and Yards After Contact
                    are subsets of Receiving Yards."

                <p class="lead">
                    In most years, being in the top 30 for Target Share, Targets, and Red Zone Targets indicated that a
                    player would likely secure a spot among the top 24 overall receivers in the following year, often
                    even within the top 12. However, a notable pattern emerged: when a player ranked in the top 30 for
                    all three stats but fell outside the top 20 overall, they tended to make a significant leap in the
                    rankings, often landing within the top 10 overall the following year. There was only one exception
                    to this trend, Terry McLaurin in 2020.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, there were instances where receivers fell out of the top 24 the following year, but this
                    was often due to injury, such as in the case of Michael Pittman in 2021.
                    <br><br>

                <p class="lead">
                    When looking at tight ends, it's easy to notice the stats that stand out are the same as the stats
                    that stood out for wide receivers, which makes sense because tight ends mainly score points as pass
                    catchers.:

                    <span class="fw-bold">- Targets (0.97)</span><br>

                <p class="lead">
                    When I took a deep dive into tight end data spanning five years, a trend similar to what we saw with
                    wide receivers emerged. If a tight end made it to the top 15 for Target Share,
                    Targets, and Red Zone Targets, they typically found themselves in the top 12 overall the following
                    year. There were a couple of outliers: Kyle Rudolph in 2018 and Tyler Higbee in 2021.
                    <br><br>
                    But here's the really interesting part - if a tight end wasn't initially in the top 10 overall, they
                    often managed to climb into that elite top 10 club the following year.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some examples:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Mike Gesicki (2019):</span> Ranked 11 -> Next Year Rank 6 <br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Hunter Henry (2020):</span> Ranked 15 -> Next Year Rank 7 <br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Dalton Schultz (2020):</span> Ranked 17 -> Next Year Rank 3 <br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Cole Kmet (2021):</span> Ranked 22 -> Next Year Rank 7 <br>

                <p class="lead">
                    To figure out our watchlist for 2023, we're keeping an eye on the top 15 players in the stats we've
                    talked about for quarterbacks and tight ends. For wide receivers and running backs, we're casting a
                    wider net and looking at the top 30 players in the relevant stats. The reason behind this is that in
                    most fantasy leagues, you've got 12 teams, and you start 1 quarterback, 1 tight end, 2 wide
                    receivers, and 2 running backs. So, we're hunting for players who can shine in the QB1/TE1 and
                    WR1-WR2/RB1-RB2 range.

                <p class="lead">In some cases, players either signed with other teams or were traded. This creates an
                    opportunity to consider their talent level vs their team: Was a player a viable fantasy option
                    because of the system they played in or because they were super talented? In my personal belief, I
                    think there are some players who will thrive as a result of some of these players who are currently
                    listed being on different teams. I am most excted to watch <span class="fw-bold">James Cook</span>
                    take over the
                    Buffalo Bills
                    backfield after Devin Singletary left to go to the Texans. I am also a strong believer in <span
                        class="fw-bold">De'Von
                        Achane</span> taking over the backfield in Miami and <span class="fw-bold">Jake Ferguson</span>
                    replacing
                    Dalton Schultz. There are
                    other examples, but these are my personal thoughts.
                    <br><br>
                    Almost every player listed here is someone that I will be taking a closer look at during the draft
                    process and am excited to watch throughout the season
