            <p class="lead2">
                By connecting to the Spotify API via the 'spotipy' package for Python, I created several functions to 
                allow myself to enter an artist's name and return a data frame containing the audio features, popularity, and release
                data from that artist's album and single releases. These helper functions work together to clean the data and 
                load it into a data frame that can be further explored. 
                <br><br>
                Running the Jupyter Notebook, the data from the data frame os printed out, showing the amount of rows, columns, number of null objects,
                data types of the columns and descriptive statistics. The descriptive statistics are visualized in several box plots and histograms using the plotly 
                interactive visuzalizations package. Then the note creates a correlation matrix with a heatmap of the audio features, compares average popularity of the artist's tracks and number of releases by years, 
                explores the artist's average track times by album, and looks at the artist's most and least popular songs.
                <br><br>
                For an example, we will analyze data from one of my favorite artists, <b>Kendrick Lamar</b>.
                <br><br> 
                If you want to try this with 
                another artist, click the link to my github and you can get the Jupyter Notebook from there.

            <h2>Kendrick Lamar Analysis</h2>
            <p class="lead2">
                Pulling the data from the spotify API, we get a data frame with 129 rows and 
                19 columns, meaning we have 129 tracks to explore. We see by checking the dataframe info none fo the entries are null, which is a good sign for us because 
                it indicates there is no missing data. We can then look at some of the descriptive stats, looking at the mean, standard deviation, percentiles, etc., 
                but it would be easier to visualize them.

            <h3>Descriptive statistics</h3>
            <p class="lead2">
                By plotting the descriptive statistics of the columns as boxplots and distributions, we can notice a few things.
                Kendrick's songs tend to have higher energy and loudness, less acoustic, and have somewhat neutral danceability and valence.
                Something to note about the danceability and valence is that the seems to be a uniform distribution across all of his tracks, 
                which can indicate that his music covers quite a range of emotions (valence).
                <br><br>
                <h3>Correlations of Audio Features</h3>
                Looking at the heatmap of the correlations between variables, we see there is a very strong positive correlation between energy and loudness,
                and weakly negative correaltions between loudness and instrumentalness, energy and instrumnetalness, and speechiness and danceability.
                The variable with the strongest positive correlation to popularity is danceability, although this relationship appears to be weak.

            <h3>Popularity by Year and Album Releases</h3>
            <p class="lead2">
                Looking at Kendrick's Popularity over the years, we see it has gradually increased. In 2010, he dropped his debut mixtape
                "Overly Dedicated", which is his least popular project. Bu, the following year we see a very large spike in his average track 
                popularity with the release of "Section.80", Lamar's first studio album. Many msuic critics agree that this album was when he 
                began tho hone his unique style of music. The following year, Lamar released "good kid, m.A.A.d city", an album that received critical
                acclaim due to its themes and storytelling elements, and such we see another increase in his tracks average popularity. 
                <br><br>
                In 2015, Lamar released "To Pimp a Butterfly", an album that focused on addressing social and racial issues in America by highlighting his own experiences
                and the experiences of those around him. Many critics would debate that "To Pimp a Butterfly" is one of if not the greatest hip-hop albums of
                all time. This is reflected in a large spike in average popularity. There is a dip in popularity in 2016, when Kendrick released
                "Unititled Unmastered", an album of ".To Pimp a Butterfly" throwaway songs. 2017 there is a huge spike in the number of tracks released.
                This is when Kendrick released his album "DAMN." as well as the collectors edition of damn. What is curious is the average popularity of is lower than what 
                could be expected with a large release. This small gain in average popularity will be explained later on. 
                <br><br>
                In 2018 we see another small jump in average popularity with the release 2018's "Black Panther" album that 
                Kendrick supervised and worked on with Marvel. It would not be until 2022 that Lamar would drop his next projext, 
                "Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers", an album that focuses on his own shortcomings as a man and the traumas that affect him
                and many other men in the world. This album was his first major release since 2017's "DAMN.", and once again we see a large spike in
                average track popularity.

            <h3>Most Popular Albums</h3>
            <p class="lead2">
               Kendricks top 3 most popular albums are "DAMN.", "Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers", and "To Pimp a Butterfly".
               His three least popular albums are "Unititled Unmastered", "Overly Dedicated", and "DAMN. COLLECTORS EDITIONS".
               His three most popular albums are also his most critically acclaimed albums, with "good kid, m.A.A.d city" right there in 
               the mix as his fourth most popular album. "Overly Dedicated" was his first ever release before he established his identiy, so it makes sense 
               this would be one of his least popular. Same with "Unititled Unmastered", the album of songs that didn't make the cut for "To Pimp a Butterfly".
               The interesting thing here is "DAMN. COLLECTORS EDTION" (DAMN. CE). 
               <br><br>
               "DAMN. CE" was released the same year as "DAMN.", but the difference is the order of the tracklist, where the songs on "DAMN." are listed in reverse 
               order on "DAMN. CE". The songs are exactly the same, but are listed as different by Spotify. Since most people listen to the DAMN and not
               "DAMN. CE", we get a mix of his most popular songs and least popular songs being in the same year, which is why we didn't see a 
               spike in average track popularity in 2017.

            <h3>Most Popular and Least Popular Songs</h3>
            <p class="lead2">
                Kendrick's most popular song is "All the Stars ft. SZA", the end credits track for the Black Panther Album. We can notice That
                10 of his top 15 most popular songs came from "DAMN." (HUMBLE, LOVE, PRIDE, DNA, LOYALTY), and "Mr Morale" 
                (N95, United in Grief, Die Hard, Rich Spirit, Count Me Out). Only 2 songs from "To Pimp a Butterfly" 
                appear in his top 15 (Alright, King Kunta), and 1 song from "good kid, m.A.A.d city" (Poetic Justice) and 1 song from 
                "Section.80" (A.D.H.D)
                <br><br>
                Looking at Kendrick's 15 least popular songs, we see 11 of those songs are on "DAMN. CE", which again explains why his
                average track popularity growth was lower than expected in 2017. The only songs that weren't on "DAMN. CE" were
                "Michael Jordan", "R.O.T.C (Interlude)", and "H.O.C" from "Overly Dedicated"  and "Ab-Souls Outro" from "Section.80"
