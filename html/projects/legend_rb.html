                <p class="lead2">
                    In this project, I set out to analyze the seasons of legendary running backs from 2019 to 2022 to
                    uncover trends in their stats from the year before they achieved legendary status. The goal was to
                    compile a list of potential legendary running backs for 2023. For the purpose of this project, I
                    defined legendary running backs as those who averaged over 20 fantasy PPR points per game.
                    <br><br>
                    I focused on volume and usage statistics, as well as the metrics I previously identified in my
                    'stats that matter' analysis. All the data I needed was sourced from FantasyPros.com, meticulously
                    cleaned, and then uploaded into my local SQL database. Over the four-year span from 2019 to 2022,
                    there were 11 legendary seasons:

                <p class="lead2">
                    Upon analyzing the seasons leading up to their legendary performances, a few key trends emerged.
                    Firstly, every single running back was under the age of 27. They also averaged 75 rush yards per
                    game and 35 receiving yards per game, highlighting their dual-threat capabilities. Additionally,
                    they averaged 287 implied attempts and 631 snaps, indicating a significant volume of play. These
                    legendary backs also averaged 19 broken tackles, 11.36 green zone attempts, and 12 explosive plays,
                    showcasing their elusiveness, power, high usage in the red zone, and ability to make big plays.
                    <br><br>
                    To identify potential candidates for 2023 who could average over 20 PPR points per game, I
                    calculated the means of these metrics and subtracted 1 standard deviation from each. The running
                    backs who exceeded these adjusted numbers, specifically in Rush/Rec Yards per game, Implied
                    Attempts, and Snaps, were singled out as promising candidates for the upcoming season. These metrics
                    were chosen because Rush/Rec Yards per game correlate with production, while Implied Attempts and
                    Snaps correlate with volume and opportunity, making them valuable indicators of breakout potential.

                <p class="lead2">
                    When we apply this methodology to the prior years, it becomes apparent that at least one of the
                    potential legendary season running backs identified went on not only to improve their prior ranking
                    but also secured a spot within the top 5 rankings.

                    It's worth noting that all of these players were within the top 6 in their respective years, except
                    for Jacobs. However, it's essential to keep in mind that this is a relatively small sample size. It
                    is
                    also important to note that while Jacobs technically did not average over 20 PPR points per game in
                    2022, he still satisfied the criteria from the previous year and ranked as the overall RB3.
                    Nevertheless, the fact that this method has consistently identified at least one top 5 ranked
                    running back from the past four years underscores its potential effectiveness. It provides us with a
                    solid starting point for identifying potential candidates for 2023.

                    Looking at this list, my personal three most likely candidates to achieve over 20 PPR points per
                    game are <span class="fw-bold">McCaffrey,
                        Pollard, and Etienne</span>. Here's why:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Christian McCaffrey</span> has consistently performed as a top running back
                    over the past five years and is
                    part of a top 5 offense.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Tony Pollard</span> has ascended to the RB1 role for the high-powered Dallas
                    Cowboys offense after spending
                    several years behind Ezekiel Elliott. (My favorite pick, as in many mock drafts his average draft
                    position is close to the end of the 2nd round or early third. He will be my number 1 target in
                    fantasy drafts.)
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Travis Etienne</span> is part of an up-and-coming Jaguars offense with high
                    expectations for offensive
                    production.
                    <br><br>
                    While these are promising candidates, it's important to remember that predicting fantasy football
                    success is never a guarantee, and many factors can come into play during a season. Nonetheless,
                    these three running backs have the potential to make a significant impact in the 2023 fantasy
                    football landscape.
