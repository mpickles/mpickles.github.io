            <p class="lead2">
                In this project, I loaded to data from previous running back analysis projects into Power bI to create visualizations of my data.
                The data contained seasonal statistics, weekly statistics, red zone statisitics, and snap-usage percentages of all fantasy relevent running backs from 2017-2023.
                Within Power BI, I created several visualizations: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Key Influences Analysis</li>
                    <li>Age vs Fantasy Points</li>
                    <li>Red Zone Usage</li>
                    <li>Snap Percentage</li>
                    <li>Running Back Stats vs Points</li>
                    <li>Efficiency</li>
                </ul> 
                In the following, I will go over Key Influences, Age vs Fantasy Points, and the Efficiency Stats. 
                I unfortuantely use the free desktop version of Power BI, so I am unable to export the interactive
                charts at this time.

                        <p>
                            In Power BI, there is an option to create a "key influences" graph that will take on column of data 
                            (dependent variable) 
                            and look for the correlations it has with the other columns of the dataset, 
                            creating a list of "key influences" of the depenedent variable. 
                            <br><br>
                            Using the Running Back data, I looked at the positive key influences of 'Fantasy Points' between
                            2017-2023, and found that some of the most important key influences of 'Fantasy Points' were
                            the number of runs that went for 10+ yards, the number of targets, and the receiving yards after contact. 
                            What this tells me is that in a fantasy running back you want a running back who has an explosive big play 
                            ability, who not only can catch the ball but is able to break contact afterwards.

                                Plotting Average Fantasy Points and Average Fantasy Points per Game by Age, and looking specifically 
                                at the top 12 running backs of each season 
                                (i.e. RB-1s),
                                we see a trend that has long been echoed by the fantasy football community for a long time: 
                                Younger Running Backs are better for Fantasy. And more specifically, Running backs younger than 28. 
                                Looking at the data from 207-2023, we see that fantasy performance peaks around age 23, and tends to decline 
                                as running backs age. At age 28, there seems to be a larger drop off in performance compared to the other ages.

                                In the efficiency chart, I looked at the top  36 running backs from 2023 who had
                                a minimum of 100 running attempts, comparing their Fantasy Points (FPTS) vs Targets (TAR) and Attempts (ATT),
                                Yards per Reception(YPR) vs  Yards per Attempt(YPA), and Yards After Contact(YACON) vs Yards Before Contact (YBCON). 
                                <br><br>
                                Fantasy Points vs Targets and Attempts indicates how efficient running backs were with the 
                                opportunities they had. Yards per reception vs Yards per Attempt indicate if a running back was more efficient
                                atrunning the ball or receiving that ball. Yards before contact gives an indication on how well a running backs o-line play
                                while yards after contact indicate how well the could rush. This is important before sometimes running bakcks numbers
                                can be inflated due to playing with a better o-line, as opposed to how well they actual can run the bi-file-bar-graph-fill

                                In the following, I want examine 5 running backs who are very intriguing for the next season and how I would rank them.

                             Some Players that stood out to me in the report were:

                             </ul>
                             <!-- CMC -->
                             <b>Christan McCaffrey</b>
                             <br>
                             McCaffrey was the number one running back in Fantasy. he had the second most YBCON
                             at 3.3 and a respectable 2.1 YACON. He was above and beyond the most 
                             efficient RB on the ground with 8.4 YPA while still boasting an impressive 5.4 YPR. 
                             What surprisng though is that he was actually below the trend line sin both FPTS vs ATT
                             and FPTS vs TAR, with 391.3 on 272 ATT and 83 TAR. Still, he put together one of the most 
                             impressive fantasy performances in the past few years and there is no reason not to think he can do it again.
                             <br><br>
                             <!-- Kyren -->

                             <br>
                             Kyren Williams had the most YBCON at 3.5, quite literally off the chart compared to the other RBs. But
                             what is interesting was he has one of the worst YACON, at 1.5, indicating his performance may be due to high 
                             usage and a good o-line. He had 5 YPA and 6.4 YPR. What this indicates is that much of his success can  be atrributed to 
                             his o-line play; he has high YPA but very low YACON. 
                             <br><br>
                             <!-- Breece Hall -->
                             <b>Breece Hall</b>
                             <br>
                             Breece Hall had 2.1 YBCON and 2.2 YACON. He would be considered high in YACON and low in YBCON, indicating poor
                             o-line play but was able to push through contact extrememly well. He has 4.5 YPA and 7.8 YPR, high in YPA and about average in 
                             YPR. What is most interesting is that FPTS vs ATT and FPTS vs TAR. In FPTS vs ATT, he still would be considered a more efficient
                             RB on the grounfd with 290 FPTs on 223 ATT. But, his FPTS vs TAR was one of the best, at 290 on 95 TAR, highly efficient.
                             Considering his effectiveness with a poor o-line and high efficiency in the recieving game, Breece Hall is one of the top targets 
                             in Fantasy drafts in 2024
                             <br><br>
                             <!-- Warren -->

                             <br>
                             Jaylen Warren had 3.2 YBCON and 2.2 YACON, one of the best overall RBs in both categories. Not only was
                             his o-line efficient but he too was efficent in his own right. He had 6.1 YPR and 5.3 YPA. His 6.1 YPR is slightly below average but 
                             He was second in YPA only behind McCaffrey, and strong indication of his efficiency. His FPTS vs TAR was above average
                             with 196 FPTS on 74 TAR, but his FPTs vs ATT was below average at 196 FPTS on 149 ATT. What I see is a very efficent 
                             RB with  a decent O-line who could be very good in fantasy next year if given more opportunities.
