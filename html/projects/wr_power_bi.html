            <p class="lead2">
                In this project, I wanted to repeat the dashboard I created for my running back analysis, but instead of cleaning the data
                using python and uploading it a mySQL database, I wanted to practice using Excel and Power Query. To start, I downloaded .csv 
                from FantasyPros.com of Wide Recevier Statistics and Wide Receiver Advanced Statistics from 2013 to 2023. These .csv files were 
                uploaded into Power Query within Excel where performed data cleaning and wrangling, using the advanced M-Code editor to speed
                up the process. In  the process, I renamed columns, chose features, and merged the advanced statistics with the regular statistics.
                The cleaned queries were then loaded into the Excel Workbook and data model.
                <br><br>
                I do not own a paid license so unfortunately I am unable to share the Power BI files.

                    After cleaning the data, the excel workbook was loaded into Power BI. Before working with the data, the different
                    queries were concatenated into one table of Wide Receiver stats from 2013-2023. In Power Bi, two visualizations were created:
                    a dashboard to explore the data by year and rank, and a key influences analysis on fantasy points.

                                    In the dashboard, there is a table that displays the WRs who meet the criteria of the rank and year splicers. 
                                    This table displays the players names, fantasy points, receptions, targets, red zone targets, catchable targets,
                                    drops and explosive plays of 20+ yards. There is a line chart showing the relationship between the number of
                                    explosive plays and fantasy points. A scatterplot shows players average yards before the catch per reception and average 
                                    yards after the catch per reception, stats that give an indication of not only a receivers efficeincy but the kind of receiver they are
                                    (deep threat, possession, playmakers, short yardage target hogs, etc. ) All around the rest of the dashboard there are cards that display the average
                                    of specific stats of the group of players that fit within the range of the criteria.

                                    The key influences visualization anlysiss the correlation between the statistics in the data and fantasy points per game.
                                    In the analysis, I specifically left out touchdowns, yardage, and receptions, as those statistics are built into fantasy scoring.
                                    The two most stats most correlated with fantasy points were catchable targets and explosive plays, which indicates to me that 
                                    receivers who are deep threats with above average to elite level quarterbacks who can throw ball deep tend to have the most success.
                                    Looking at the top receivers in 2023, this would make sense as 8 of the top 12 recevier were above average in either yards before the catch per reception (deep threat)
                                    or yards after the catch per reception (playmakers). The three receviers who were above average in both categories were 
                                    Tyreek Hill (WR2) who missed several games due to injury, DJ Moore (WR6), and Nico Collins (WR12), who also missed several games due to injury.
                                    Tyreek Hill had Tua Tagovailoa at QB and Nico Collins had CJ Stroud, both of which were selected to the Pro Bowl. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    It would unwise to rank Wide Receviers in next years fantasy draft only based on these visualizations, but they
                                    are a very helpful tool I look forward to using when the fantasy season starts up again and I can compare these stats
                                    with players average draft position to find value picks.
